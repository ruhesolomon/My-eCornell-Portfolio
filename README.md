# Define and Solve ML Problem  
### Book Review Sentiment Classification

This project implements the full machine learning lifecycle on a **book review sentiment** dataset.  
Using review text and simple engineered features, it predicts whether a review is **positive** or **negative**.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to demonstrate how to define a real-world problem as a machine learning task, perform data exploration and feature engineering, train and evaluate a model, and interpret results.  

It walks through each major ML pipeline stage — **problem definition → data preprocessing → model training → evaluation → interpretation** — in a single Jupyter notebook.
